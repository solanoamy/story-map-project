## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose a topic

Choose a topic that is fruitfully explained with some combination of narrative and geographic elements. Think about what data you want to tell a story about. Whatever data you use, **be sure to include citations somewhere in your app interface**. You can choose a dataset from any of a number of sources, for example:

* Use data you've been working with for another class
* Create your own dataset (check out [geojson.io](https://geojson.io))
* Find data from an open data repository...

#### OpenDataPhilly.org

OpenDataPhilly has lots of Philadelphia-specific data, like:

- [Neighborhood Boundaries](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-neighborhoods)
- Historic [Streets](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/historic-streets), [Districts](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-registered-historic-districts), or [Properties](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-registered-historic-sites)
- [School Information](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/school-information-data)
- [PA Horticultural Society Land Care](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/land-care)

#### Other open data portals

Many other cities, counties, states, and countries have dedicated data portals as well. Here are a couple of lists of state-sponsored open data sites:

- [Data.gov - Open Government](https://data.gov/open-gov/)
- [Open Knowledge Foundation - DataPortals.org](https://dataportals.org/)

#### Independently compiled data sources

Sources like [Stop Demolishing Philly](https://www.stopdemolishingphilly.com/map/) or other privately compiled data sources.


Use one of the template story maps in the _templates/_ folder, modified as you see fit, to explain your topic. For example, open [templates/scrollytelly/](templates/scrollytelly/) and copy the contents to the root folder in this repository. You can then modify the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data to suit your needs.

### Step 2: Think About Slide Content

Your story will have multiple slides, each with a title, some additional text, maybe images, and geographic data. Your slide content will go straight into your HTML, and your map features will go in to separate GeoJSON files in the [data/](data/) folder.

### Step 3: Submit your story map

Commit your code and push it to your repository on GitHub. Set up GitHub pages on the repository and submit a new pull request into the original project repository in the class organization.
